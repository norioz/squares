squares
=======

Squares app for testing build.phonegap and the feasibility of full JS animation.

Each of the simulations does all its drawing on a HTML5 canvas
and does all processing in javascript. On phones the canvas fills
the screen. In a web browser the canvas is a fixed size.

The application allows users to pick from the following simulations:

***Squares

Draws 100 moving sprite blocks and has them bounce around the screen.

***Zombies

2. draw a bunch of monsters
3. animate the monsters
4. jump!
